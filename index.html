    <p>You know what, Your life began on this day but My life began the day I met you. I’m so glad both days happened. I did not want to let this special day for you (and for me) go by without writing you a few words. I think about them a lot, I admit it, but I also admit that sometimes I find it difficult to say them out loud. Anyways,let's get it started.It has been a long time(85 days,haha!) since we met, and when I think about it, two things happen to me: I feel like it was yesterday but that, at the same time, we have experienced many things.You made everything simple from the beginning.Little by little, we were living things together, our scarborough bluffs meetings and my Cambridge trips that we never want to end. Choosing you was, without a doubt, the best decision. I can’t imagine how it would have been all this time without you, just as I can’t imagine what the days to come would be like. Since we decided to start this journey together, I have had the opportunity to admire you as a friend, person, and, of course, as a couple. I admire you and love you in equal parts. Your ability to excel, see the glass half full, get a smile out of everything, your tenacity, and your stubbornness. There are many things that I have been able to discover about you. Sometimes i think back to the first time i laid eyes on you. i knew it that i had found someone incredible. Ever since that moment,all i ever wanted was to be with you. No matter how dark my day is,seeing you always brightens it and makes me realise that with you, i am doing right. With all this, who is going to think of a future without you? I can’t imagine it. For this reason, I wanted to write down my life commitment to you. Everything that lies ahead will not be wonderful, I assure you. There will be good days and bad days. There will be unforgettable days and days that we will want to erase at a stroke, and we will not be able to do it, but what we will do is continue as before: together, inseparable. Therefore, </p>
    <ul>  
    <li>I promise to hold you when everything is falling apart around you.</li>
      <li>I am committed to praying with you when there is no other solution but to vent.</li>
      <li> I promise to smile with you in the good things that happen to you.</li>
      <li> I promise to love you, yes, in my own way.</li>
      <li>I promise to try to understand how you feel, whatever the situation may be, and to speak all that is necessary to solve things. Don’t keep them for me. </li>
      </ul>
      I am clear that I do not want to get away from you. I want this to continue growing, maturing, and that each day that passes, we can look back and see what we have built between the two. 
      So Finallyyyyyyy, I wish you A VERY HAPPY BIRTHDAY, life partner, and may we continue to celebrate it for many more years!
